# Assumptions

## Your Assumptions
* You can assume that the id columns have a foreign key relationship.
* You cannot assume each id exists in both tables.
* If you have other assumptions, please write them out and send them with your code.

## My Assumptions
* Routing is not needed for this demonstration
* Design: Material is suitible for application
* Must be mobile responsive
* Every Row is assumed to have an ID
* If there are rows with duplicate ID's its possible those rows will get overwritten
* In a real-world example I would look to do data-munging like this on the backend
* No need to do feature branching for this test

## My Future Considerations
* A debounce should be added to filter input
* Filtering code could be improved to be more dynamic
* Sorting could be added to table with mat-sort
* Loading Indicator could be added
